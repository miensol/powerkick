Welcome to the powerkick project.
=============================

powerkick is a deployment tool for building systematic deployment scripts
Ideas, names and even some functions come directly from **great project** [Dropkick](https://github.com/chucknorris/dropkick "Dropkick"). 
As a mean of learning Powershell I decided to write this tool.

Note that powerkick is in very early development stage...
